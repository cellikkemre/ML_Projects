# Salary Prediction with Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting the salaries of baseball players using their career statistics from the 1986 season. The dataset, originally from Carnegie Mellon University's StatLib library, includes 20 variables and 322 observations, with salary data sourced from Sports Illustrated and career stats from the 1987 Baseball Encyclopedia Update.

### Objective
The main objective is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the salaries of baseball players using their 1986 career statistics.

### Models Used
Several machine learning models were utilized, including regression models and ensemble methods. These models were evaluated and optimized through hyperparameter tuning to improve prediction accuracy, and finally, the most successful model was selected.

### How to Run
1. **Install the required packages and Run the main script **

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python main.py
This will execute the entire pipeline, from loading the data to evaluating the models.
